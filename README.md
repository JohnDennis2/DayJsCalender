Work Day Scheduler

This app was task to use DayJs to make a calender that users could input events and task they need to do.
The app displays the current time in a text block at the top of the page.
The divs are made to change color depending on the hour that the user is currently at during their interaction.
We also needed to allow for user input i.e. events and task be able to save in the appropriate text area, even after the page was refreshed.
